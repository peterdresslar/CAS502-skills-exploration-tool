# Skills Exploration Tools

This is a starter repository for projects in the CAS502 class in the School of Complex Adaptive Systems at Arizona State University. If you choose to use the code in this repository for your project, please clone it into your own account and work with your clone.

## What the code does

This script will read the skills in `data/Skills.xlsx` (which is pretty much a list of types of jobs and what skills each job requires) and create a weighted graph from it. Each skill is identified by an "Element ID" of the form `Number.Letter.Number.letter` (e.g. `2.A.1.a`). The script will create a node for each skill id and if two skills are used in the same job type, the nodes will be connected. The more often two skills are used together for a job type, the greater the weight on the edge between those two nodes. The resulting network looks something like that (darker and thicker edges have more weight):

After creating the network, the script will ask the user for a skill id and then print the first 10 skills most often used with the entered skill and 5 job types in which both skills are used, e.g.

```
Often used skills with "Active Learning (2.A.2.b)":
"Active Listening (2.A.1.b)" e.g. as Judges, Magistrate Judges, and Magistrates (5.0), Marriage and Family Therapists (4.88), Child, Family, and School Social Workers (4.88), Editors (4.88), Historians (4.75)
...
```

## Set up

To set up the project, clone the repository. You need the following packages installed:
- pandas
- openpyxl
- networkx
- matplotlib

## How to run the code

To execute the tool, simply run `python skills.py`. It will run for a few moments and then ask you for a skill code. You can find the codes for each skill in the file `skills-list.csv` (e.g. `2.A.1.a` for "Reading Comprehension"). Once entered, the program will present you with a list of 10 skills are that are most often used in combination with the entered skill and the top five professions in which a skill is important for.

## Repository content

The following files are part of this repository:

- `skills.py`  
The code for this program.
- `skills-list.csv`  
CSV file with a list of skills and their codes.
- `data`  
This folder contains a number of data files. The files have been downloaded from [O*NET Resource Center](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html), version 29.1 ([license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)). The file currently used in the code is `Skills.xlsx`. Additionally, there are two files in this folder:
  - `Occupation Data.xlsx`: Descriptions for each occupation.
  - `TechnologySkills.xlsx`: A list of technological skills for each occupation.

## Updated for uv compatibility

This starter repo has been updated to be easy to manage and run using the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv). If you have `uv` [installed and configured](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) on your system, a recommended first step is to create and activate a virtual environment where your project will run:

```bash
uv venv
# if on mac
source .venv/bin/activate
# windows command prompt
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# windows powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
The packages are already listed in the pyproject project description. Install them with :

```bash
uv sync
```

Finally, you are ready to run. You can use the standard `python` command from above, or use the configured uv runner: this will ensure that the command runs in the configured environment with the required dependencies:

```bash
uv run skills.py
```

## Notes

This repository is intentially left pretty barebone, so you can use it for all the assignments in CAS502.
